# Customer-behavior-analysis-in-a-hotel-franchise-management-system

This project analyzes customer behaviour in a hotel franchise management system using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and Power BI. The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
    * Use SQL Server Management Studio to combine data from three tables: `2018`, `2019`, and `2020` into a single table named `hotels`.
    * Create three additional tables: `market_segment`, `meal_cost`, and `revenue`.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   The analysis utilizes data from the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, encompassing various aspects of customer behaviour and revenue generation. The following key findings emerged from the analysis:
   A. **Revenue Growth:** Hotel revenue has consistently grown over the years, indicating a positive trend in customer demand.
   B. **Market Segment Analysis:** Revenue patterns differ across market segments, highlighting the importance of tailoring marketing strategies to specific customer groups.
   C. **Meal Preferences:** Meal preferences influence customer spending, suggesting opportunities to optimize meal offerings.

3. **Data Visualization:**
    * Create a Power BI dashboard to visualize the results of the data analysis.
