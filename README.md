# Customer-behavior-analysis-in-a-hotel-franchise-management-system

This project demonstrates the application of data analysis techniques to gain valuable insights into customer behaviour in a hotel franchise management system. The findings can be used to improve marketing strategies, optimize pricing, and enhance customer satisfaction.

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
    * Use SQL Server Management Studio to combine data from three tables: `2018`, `2019`, and `2020` into a single table named `hotels`.
    * Create three additional tables: `market_segment`, `meal_cost`, and `revenue`.

2. **Data Analysis:**

   The analysis utilizes data from the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, encompassing various aspects of customer behaviour and revenue generation. The following key findings emerged from the analysis:

   A. **Revenue Growth:** Hotel revenue has consistently grown over the years, indicating a positive trend in customer demand.
   B. **Market Segment Analysis:** Revenue patterns differ across market segments, highlighting the importance of tailoring marketing strategies to specific customer groups.
   C. **Meal Preferences:** Meal preferences influence customer spending, suggesting opportunities to optimize meal offerings.

4. **Data Visualization:**
    * Create a Power BI dashboard to visualize the results of the data analysis.

The analysis reveals the following key findings:

* The demand starts to increase steadily in March and continues to grow until it reaches its peak in August.
* City and Resort hotels both have roughly equal market shares in terms of revenue.
* 'TA/TO' accounts for the largest share of bookings, with 'Direct' bookings coming in as a close second.
* Type-A rooms are consistently the most sought-after room type throughout the year.
* Over two-fifths of customers, approximately 41%, choose to make a room reservation without providing a deposit.
